Refactored all the methods and classes requested by the exercise:

1 - Move some of the code in _check_bullet_alien_collisions(), which starts a new level
when the fleet of aliens has been destroyed, to a function called start_new
_level().

2 - Move the four separate method calls in the __init__() method
in Scoreboard to a method called prep_images() to shorten __init__().

3 - The prep_images() method could also help simplify _check_play_button() or start
_game() if youâ€™ve already refactored _check_play_button().
